🔍 1️⃣ Query for Failed Login Attempts (Event ID 4625)
This query finds all failed login attempts, groups them by user and IP address, and sorts them by the number of failed attempts.

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625 
| stats count by Account_Name, IpAddress
| sort -count

📊 Expected Output:
List of users who had failed login attempts.
IP addresses from which failed logins originated.
Helps detect potential brute-force attacks.

🔍 2️⃣ Query for Successful Logins (Event ID 4624)
This query finds all successful logins, groups them by user and IP address, and sorts them to see which accounts logged in the most.

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624 
| stats count by Account_Name, IpAddress
| sort -count

📊 Expected Output:
List of users who successfully logged in.
IP addresses used for successful logins.
Helps check if an attacker successfully accessed an account.

🔍 3️⃣ Query to Identify Logon Types (Event ID 4624)
This query helps determine how users logged in (e.g., Remote Desktop, Local Logon, Network Logon).

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624 
| stats count by Logon_Type, Account_Name, IpAddress
| sort -count

📊 Expected Output:
Logon Type 2: Interactive (physical login).
Logon Type 3: Network logon (shared folders).
Logon Type 10: Remote Desktop (suspicious if unexpected).
Helps identify if an attacker accessed the system remotely.

🔍 4️⃣ Query to Detect Brute-Force Attacks (Multiple 4625 Events from the Same IP)
This query checks for repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address, which may indicate a brute-force attack.

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625 
| stats count by IpAddress
| where count > 5
| sort -count

📊 Expected Output:
Shows IP addresses with more than 5 failed login attempts.
Helps detect brute-force attacks.

🔍 5️⃣ Query to Detect Suspicious Login Locations (Compare IPs of 4624 and 4625 Events)
This query identifies cases where a failed login attempt (4625) and a successful login attempt (4624) happen from the same IP address.

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625) 
| stats values(EventCode) by Account_Name, IpAddress
| where mvcount(EventCode) > 1

📊 Expected Output:
Shows cases where the same IP attempted multiple failed logins (4625) and then successfully logged in (4624).
Helps detect if an attacker guessed the correct password.

🔍 6️⃣ Query to Detect Multiple Successful Logins from Different Locations
If an attacker logs in from a new location, this query helps identify it.

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624 
| stats dc(IpAddress) by Account_Name
| where dc(IpAddress) > 1

📊 Expected Output:
Shows accounts that logged in from more than one IP address.
Helps detect account takeovers from different geographic locations.
