# SOC-Login-Detection-Splunk

"Implemented a SOC use case to detect and investigate suspicious logins using Windows Security Logs and Splunk.

Analyzed failed (4625) and successful (4624) login attempts to identify potential brute-force attacks or compromised accounts.

Used Splunk queries to detect login anomalies based on IP address, logon type, and event frequency.

Created a detailed incident report and proposed security measures (MFA, account lockout, firewall rules)".
